# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project is a machine learning solution for the famous **Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition.  
The task is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck, based on features such as age, sex, class, and more.
